<b> Negative emotions like loneliness, envy, and guilt have an important role to play in a happy life; they're big, flashing signs that something needs to change. Gretchen Rubin </b>

Loneliness is a complex and usually unpleasant emotional response to isolation. Loneliness typically includes anxious feelings about a lack of connection or communication with other beings, both in the present and extending into the future. As such, loneliness can be felt even when surrounded by other people. The causes of loneliness are varied and include social, mental, emotional and physical factors.

Did you know that in Korea, people are recording themselves while having dinner? And people are actually paying to watch these videos! Is this another sign of loneliness creeping up on all of us?
According to a study of more than 170,000 people published at the Psychology Bulletin in 2013, the average adult’s network of friends and colleagues have shrunk over the past 3 decades. It’s no wonder many people feel lonelier than ever.
Feeling lonely, however, is not a direct cause of being alone. It’s possible to feel lonely in a crowd.
Loneliness, in fact, is more dangerous than isolation because it increases a person’s mortality rate, according to John Cacioppo, co-author of Loneliness: Human Nature and the Needs for Social Connection.
If it’s so dangerous, how do we fight loneliness then?

The lamp is the solution for it. It helps fight loneliness with its smart interactive system which will be developed using google assistant API as well as tensor flow support.
The interactive 180 degrees movement in four directions makes it much more interactive and appealing  for the user.It has various features similar to a virtual assistant as well as monitoring system which could keep track of kids education or the monitoring of the elderly.It could also be set to share emoticons through its display which will be set up at the final stages of the project.

The movement of the lamp is controlled using 4 servo motors and 4 strings hence enabling the motion similar to that of a snake.( Movement mechanism cannot be explained in text but could be demonstrated).
